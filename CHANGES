Version 0.95: 
-------------
* Another try on the opengl issue : Now updating textures from the init() method called 
  by opengl, let's hope that finally fixes it! 
* SoftFullScreen support, is like a "always on top" window. So you can't change resolution, 
  but you can span across multiple monitors. 
* Shortcuts are still enabled by default, but you can turn them off using 
  disableKeys()
